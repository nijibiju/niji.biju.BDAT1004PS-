    "• If the word starts with a consonant, move that letter to the end and append'ay'. For example, 'happy' becomes 'appyhay' and 'pencil' becomes 'encilpay'.\n",
    "• If the word starts with a vowel, simply append 'way' to the end of the word.For example, 'enter' becomes 'enterway' and 'other' becomes 'otherway' . Forour purposes, there are 5 vowels: a, e, i, o, u (so we count y as a consonant).Write a function pig() that takes a word (i.e., a string) as input and returns its pig-Latin form. Your function should still work if the input word contains upper casecharacters. Your output should always be lower case however."
